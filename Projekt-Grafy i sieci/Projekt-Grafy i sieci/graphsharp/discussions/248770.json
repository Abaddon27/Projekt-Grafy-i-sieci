When approaching a count of 200&#43; vertices or 600&#43; edges, loading time increases from a split\r\n second, to several, and sometimes even minutes. I understand this has to do with the layout algorithm, but I need to either make it quicker, or some how have the layout rendered on a&nbsp;separate&nbsp;thread; yet still be on the same WPF form. Any suggestions?</p>\r\n",
