The Problem is (regardless which Tree Generation Algorithm I use to create the Tree) the start node is on the left side, the end node is in the middle and 40 nodes are on the right side.<br />\n<br />\nI need something like that:<br />\n<br />\n<img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/RkEeZ.jpg\" alt=\"Image\" />.<br />\n<br />\nIn addition the layout overlap removal algorithms also take no effect.<br />\n<br />\nThanks in advance :-)<br />\n<br />\nRegards <br />\nMarkus<br />\n",
