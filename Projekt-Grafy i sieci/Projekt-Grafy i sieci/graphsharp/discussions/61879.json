I've been working on this problem myself and as you probably already know it's pretty challenging. I'm having trouble finding resources to help me along. If this capability is currently under development, can anyone recommend any resources? I'm definitely interested in sharing ideas on the topic, especially if it helps GraphSharp in the process. Thanks!</p>\r\n<p>Tom</p>",
