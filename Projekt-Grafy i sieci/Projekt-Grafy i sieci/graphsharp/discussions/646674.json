I've got it working in my app and now need to figure out how to get a reference to the selected vertex, or change the selected vertex. \r<br />\n<br />\nMy app is MVVM and I need to access the selected vertex from the view model using binding. I need a property that is set when the user clicks on a vertex and I need to change the selected vertex in the view model and have the graph update accordingly when the user performs some action (for example clicking the &quot;add vertex&quot; button.).\r<br />\n<br />\nHow can this be accomplished?\r<br />\n<br />\nThanks\r<br />\n<br />\nStuart<br />\n",
