Tutorial from youtube:&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VTbuvkaPGxE\">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VTbuvkaPGxE</a>&nbsp;is good when I coded. However when I replace the type of data from\r\n BidirectionalGraph to UndirectedGraph,(both interface and data type of variable g) there is no error as well as no graph on layout window. I wonder what happened. Anyone could explain and give me a sample code.</p>\r\n<p>Thanks a lot!</p>\r\n",
