As it is not included in the source code, I had a look at the official microsoft web site, but it appears there is only an educational and a commercial license. And the commercial license applies to use in VS team system, which I don't have, I'm using the pro version.</p>\r\n<p>Is it possible to get rid of the Code Contracts dependency? Doesn't look like it's really crucial to the component.</p>\r\n<p>Thanks!</p>\r\n<p>Wout</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>",
