I wrote a graph layout library a long time ago in C# (UserControl abuse!) that was easy... but with WPF/Graph# I don't even know inherently where the vertex/edge objects live? I presume that's a blessing in disguise, as you guys and gals knowing WPF better wouldn't do it that way anyway?</p>\r\n<p>2) I'd like to be able style graph elements dependent on the type of data they represent/connect. Obviously there is only so much flexibility afforded within the generics that are already written in - but maybe there could be overrides to specify independent styles when adding vertices and edges programmatically. Or maybe there is a better way and I'm missing the point?</p>\r\n<p>Naturally I could put these things in place myself, but I don't want to add a less than universal fixup if these things are already on the roadmap.</p>\r\n<p>Thank you, and props for the truly fantastic work!</p>",
