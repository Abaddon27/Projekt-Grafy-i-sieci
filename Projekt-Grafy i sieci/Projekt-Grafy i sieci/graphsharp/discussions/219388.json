Of course that means that zooming is not very smooth but I fixed that by setting the AnimationLenght to 0 when a vertex is clicked and back to half a second when the mouse is released. Hope that helps somewhat.\r<br />\n<br />\nAlso, this is unrelated, but you can set the MaxZoomDelta of the zoomControl so it won't zoom out a lot more than it zooms in (I set it to 2).<br />\n",
