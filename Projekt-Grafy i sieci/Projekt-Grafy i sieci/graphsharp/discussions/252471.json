I am working in a visualization and I need to have a graph with vertices that can have different sizes and colors depending of a set of attributes, I know I can do it by changing the bindings and the dataTemplate of the Vertex,  but in the example I don't know which one is the one I have to modify , any help is welcome</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Thanks</p>\n<p>Julian</p>",
