My particular example is the following graph:<br />\n<pre><code>    public class DDNAGraph : BidirectionalGraph&lt;DDNAVertex, DDNAEdge&gt;\n    {\n        public DDNAGraph() { }\n\n        public DDNAGraph(bool allowParallelEdges)\n            : base(allowParallelEdges) { }\n\n        public DDNAGraph(bool allowParallelEdges, int vertexCapacity)\n            : base(allowParallelEdges, vertexCapacity) { }\n\n    }\n    public class DDNAGraphLayout : GraphLayout&lt;DDNAVertex, DDNAEdge, DDNAGraph&gt; { }\n    public class DDNAEdge : Edge&lt;DDNAVertex&gt;\n    {\n        public DDNAEdge(DDNAVertex source, DDNAVertex target)\n            : base(source, target)\n        {\n        }\n    }\n\n    public class DDNAVertex\n    {\n        public string ID { get; set; }\n        public bool exists { get; set; }\n\n        public DDNAVertex(string id, bool Fexists)\n        {\n            ID = id;\n            exists = Fexists;\n        }\n\n        public override string ToString()\n        {\n            return string.Format(&quot;{0}-{1}&quot;, ID, exists);\n        }\n    }</code></pre>\n\nIt is a graph of documents showing paths of copy pasted content in between them. The long term goal is to allow to user to click on any of the vertices and open up the related document. The ID attribute of the vertices is the path of the represented document.<br />\n",
