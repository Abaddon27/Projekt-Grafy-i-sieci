I&nbsp;noticed that if I call a few times ContinueLayout() on a displayed graph, all the vertices get moved down and\r\n right with each call to ContinueLayout(). The same effect also occurs if I add vertices to a shown graph. With each call to AddVertex() the vertices get moved down and right. This effect dissapears if I don't use any algorithm for removing overlap between\r\n vertices.</p>\r\n<p>I have a simple project that illustrates this issue. You can download it at: <a href=\"http://www.mediafire.com/?lso59n3j9a3o2ra\">\r\nhttp://www.mediafire.com/?lso59n3j9a3o2ra</a></p>\r\n<p>Do you have any idea what is causing this problem and how to fix it? There is no problem if I call Relayout() instead of ContinueLayout() but Relayout makes a completely different graph each time so it is not the best choice for me.</p>\r\n<p>Thank you for your help.</p>\r\n<p>Gregor</p>\r\n",
