I can't say it is much performant but you can give it a try to see if it will be sufficient for your needs. Also you can try to Cache canvas into a bitmap to speed up rendering. This will make zooming and interacting with graph less efficient but you will navigate large graphs with better performance. You need the <strong>CacheMode</strong> property.<br />\n",
