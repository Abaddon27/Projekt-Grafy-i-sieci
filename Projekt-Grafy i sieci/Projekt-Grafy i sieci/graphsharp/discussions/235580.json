The trick to getting it to work is not to nest Zoom controls as there is&nbsp;a bug in that control which prevents it working. and also to ensure that the first graph is fully loaded and\r\n displayed before you add inner graphs for each of its vertex, other than this it all works :)</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"color:#000000\">David</span></p>\r\n",
