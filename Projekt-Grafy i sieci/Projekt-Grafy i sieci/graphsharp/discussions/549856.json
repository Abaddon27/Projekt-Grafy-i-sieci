Which classes/methods do I have to use ?<br />\n<br />\nThank you very much for your help.<br />\n",

    "Html": "Hi, Graph# possibly allows to do what you need to, but ,honestly, i don't remember how and where are all the needed stuff :/<br />\nI can advice you to look at <a href=\"https://github.com/panthernet/GraphX\" rel=\"nofollow\">GraphX</a>, it has the same algorithms base. You can use smth like:<br />\n<pre><code>new AlgorithmFactory&lt;DataVertex, DataEdge, BidirectionalGraph&lt;DataVertex, DataEdge&gt;&gt;().CreateLayoutAlgorithm(LayoutAlgorithmTypeEnum.BoundedFR, graph).VertexPositions</code></pre>\n\nto get vertex positions for specified algorithms. Or you can manualy create and run algorithm. I suppose you will have to use two PCL libs: Common and Logic.<br />\nIf you'll have any questions feel free to ask on the forums on the main web site.<br />\n",
