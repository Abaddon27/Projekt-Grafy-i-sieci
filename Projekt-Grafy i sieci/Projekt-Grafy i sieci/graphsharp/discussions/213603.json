(Like the EfficientSugiyama does).\r\nThe problem I am encountering is that my TaggedEdge's overlap and makes the tag unreadable.\r\n\r\nSo a few questions:\r\n1. Is it only possible to have separate edges using the EfficientSugiyama? Or which graphs support multiple (separate) edges between vertices?\r\n2. Is there a way to add some sort of special edge to the graphs to allow for this functionality?\r\n3. Otherwise, is there a way to set the distance between the edges in the EfficientSugiyama graph?\r\n\r\nThank you,\r\n\r\nrootme",
