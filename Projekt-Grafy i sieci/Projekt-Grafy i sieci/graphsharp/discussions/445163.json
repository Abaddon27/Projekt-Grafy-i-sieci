    "Html": "I got it by doing HighlightAlgorithmType=&quot;Simple&quot; in the graphLayout section in the xaml. But the issue is I also have a highlighting(say H1) done on the vertex based on the context menu click . And this(H1) highlighting is overridden by Simple Highlighting algorithm when i hover the mouse. I need both the highlightings to be present. i.e by default SimpleHighlighting should be there and when i click on the context menu of the vertex i need that H1 highlighting to appear. Not sure how to achieve this. <br />\n",
