Whenever I replace the graph:<br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; graph = new Graph()<br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; graph.Addvertex(...)&nbsp; //in a loop</p>\r\n<p>the display flickers (= showing the new and the old graph for a while until the the new graph is finally displayed)</p>\r\n<p>I guess&nbsp;that I am not using the lib in the right fashion. Can anybody give me a glue what I am doing wrong. Is there any documentation how to do such a thing.</p>\r\n<p>Thank you very much!</p>\r\n<p>Thomas</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n",

I have tried setting the AnimationEnabled to false, but it doesn't help - it is still flickering...</p>\r\n<p>nevertheless you provided the right hint: there are three other Properties (AnimationLength, AnimationDisablerEdgeCount and AninationDisablerVertexCount).
