The class \"StandardEdgeRoutingAlgorithmFactory\" is just a dummy and does nothing as creating null's. The RoutedEdges method then should do the work in algorithm.Compute() but this only leads to the interface of it. My question is, is there any information available how to implement a routing algorithm correctly.</p>",
