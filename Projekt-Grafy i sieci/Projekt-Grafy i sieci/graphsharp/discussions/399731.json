For that reason I want to use the Graph# library but unfortunately my project cannot load the Graph# assemblies. Is this because the assemblies have to be loaded\r\n another way round when writing a plugin?</p>\r\n<p>In the XAML when I use the GraphLayout control I get the following <strong>XamlParseException:</strong></p>\r\n<p><strong>Could not load file or assembly 'GraphSharp.Controls, PublicKeyToken=null' or one of its dependencies. The system cannot find the file.</strong></p>\r\n<p>But I referenced the assemblies, they are listed in the references list. What's the problem? Could it be that assemblies have to be referenced another way round than usual when writing a&nbsp;<strong>Visual Studio Package</strong>?</p>\r\n<p>I asked this question in more detail on Stackoverflow under&nbsp;<a href=\"http://stackoverflow.com/questions/12931510/xamlparseexception-when-using-graph-libraries\">http://stackoverflow.com/questions/12931510/xamlparseexception-when-using-graph-libraries</a>.\r\n Please feel free to help me out with this issue there or here.</p>\r\n<p>Thanks in advance!<br>\r\nCheers</p>\r\n",
