I really enjoy the clear design of this project.&nbsp;<br>I want to confirm whether the Graph# and QuickGraph dependent to Microsoft GLEE or MSAGL library or not.&nbsp; Since both GLEE and MSAGL could be only used in non-commercial purpose. While we have one project that to use Sugiyama layout algorithm. Do Graph# implement the Sugiyama algorithm independent of GLEE library, or on top of&nbsp;it?&nbsp;Is there any limits for use Graph# in commercial application beside the agreement in License(<a href=\"http://graphsharp.codeplex.com/license\">http://graphsharp.codeplex.com/license</a>)?&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Thanks!<br>Michael</p>",
