I don't see a way very easily to do this in the IBidrectionalGraph, although I noticed a HierarchicalGraph. HierarchicalGraph seems to support both Hierarchical and General edges (perfect!). Except that I am unable to get anything to display whne rendering the graph using &lt;GraphLayout&gt;.</p>\r\n<p>Has anyone used or done something like this before? And are there any samples available?</p>",
