One thing I can't work out is to how to space everything so they don't overlap, no matter what values I enter and can't seem to make it work. I am adding 100 or so vertices and\r\n they are just clumped in the middle, except when using the Circle layout.</p>\r\n<p>I would like the size of the layout to expand according to the size of the graph with no overlap.</p>\r\n<p>Any help appreciated.</p>\r\n<p>Thanks</p>\r\n",
