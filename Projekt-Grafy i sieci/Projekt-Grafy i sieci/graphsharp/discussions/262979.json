I need multi-touch interaction support for some of the layout in graph-sharp and wondering writing an API [or having one] for that will be really great.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>As we have some common interest, if you agree we can work together on extending multi-touch support for&nbsp;graph sharp.</p>\r\n<p>If you let me know your progress so far we can create a project in codeplex and start from there.</p>\r\n<p>You can also contact me via skype (zabed.akbar) or gmail (zabed.akbar).</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Have a nice day.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>~Zabed</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>",
