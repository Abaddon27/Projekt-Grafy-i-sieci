    "Description": "Basically I want to mouse down in a blank area, drag the mouse down and to the right, to make a square selection area and select all the vertices in that area. Then I want to move all the selected vertices by by dragging them to the side(like a normal vertex, only more than one at a time).\r\n\r\nAny advice will be appreciated.",
