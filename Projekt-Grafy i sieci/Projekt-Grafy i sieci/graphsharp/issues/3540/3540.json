The fix is a bit of a hack, and I think we need to investigate further and try to figure out a better fix, but at least it stops the exception from occurring when doing the hover.  I encountered this in my own codebase, but my use case was similar to yours, and this is the same place I think I saw the exception, so I suspect this is fixed.",
