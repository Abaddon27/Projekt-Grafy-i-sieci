    "Description": "I am getting this issue becauses the _layers array is empty. SugiyamaPhase2Sweep is called with the start argument set to 1 in the sweeping up stage of Phase2, but the number of layers is never examined before checking that there are at least two layers.\n\nIn the SugiyamaPhase1 method, there is a guard clause like this:\n    if (_layers.Count < 2)\n        return false;\n\nShould there be something similar at the start of the Phase2 method? If so, what should the unorderedLayerIndex and baryCentering out parameters be set to in this case?",
