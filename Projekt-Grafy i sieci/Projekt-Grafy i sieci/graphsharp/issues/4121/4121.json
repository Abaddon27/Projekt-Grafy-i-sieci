    "Description": "I am just starting with Graph# and if I'm going through with it, I'll be needing to extend QuickGraph as well.\r\nSo the first thing I tried is to switch to the current QuickGraph version (36564, using 3.0).\r\n\r\nIt turns out the Graph# example application requires a tiny change: removing an argument in a method call.\r\nAfter that it will compile and run just fine.\r\n\r\nI haven't done any other testing, and the updated QuickGraph.dll isn't included.\r\nThis is just for your information.",
