    "Description": "## Feature Request\r\nAdd an `IsComputingLayout` property to the `GraphLayout` class. The addition should be a dependency property so that it can be bound to in XAML.\r\n\r\n## Rationale\r\nThis would allow callers to determine if the `GraphLayout` is currently executing a layout algorithm asynchronously. This, in turn, would be useful to indicate to users that the control is working on laying out the graph.\r\n\r\n## Note\r\nI intend to fork and implement this feature myself but I created this issue in case someone else can get to it before me.",
