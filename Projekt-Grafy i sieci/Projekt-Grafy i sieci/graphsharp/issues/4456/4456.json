    "Description": "I am presently using an IMutableBidirectionalGraph, and any time a vertex or edge is deleted it likes to relayout itself. My XAML setup is:\r\n\r\n        <v:StateGraphLayout Graph=\"{Binding Path=GraphData}\"\r\n                            LayoutAlgorithmType=\"KK\"\r\n                            OverlapRemovalAlgorithmType=\"FSA\"\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tHighlightAlgorithmType=\"Simple\">\r\n\r\nIn any case, every time it does a relayout it seems to shift down and to the right. As a result, the graph quickly disappears off the screen. You may want to fix this, as I suspect it is not the intended behavior for layout. :)",
