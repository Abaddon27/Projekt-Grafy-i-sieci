    "Description": "The edge of the compound shoots off if I try to drag a vertex inside a compound where that vertex is the only child in that compound.\n\nTo reproduce:\nCreate a parent vertex and add one (1) child to it.\n\nHack-solution:\nMy hack-solution is to disable dragging for any single child-item by attaching a global / class MouseDown-listener to the VertexControl-type and execute the following code: \nVertexControl vc= sender as VertexControl;\nPocVertex parent = graph.GetParent(vc.Vertex as PocVertex);\nif(parent != null && graph.GetChildrenCount(parent) < 2) \n  e.Handled = true;\n\nKind regards, Richard",
